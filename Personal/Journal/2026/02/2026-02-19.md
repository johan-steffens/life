## Evening (Interactive Reflection)
<!-- Refined through the new 'evening' skill protocol -->
Today was defined by a heavy, despondent weight—a natural resonance with the events of yesterday. I struggled to show up as my "usual self," but in that struggle, I found a deeper alignment with the goal of **Equilibrium**. Instead of forcing logic or productivity, I chose to practice self-compassion: allowing the feelings to exist without the immediate need to understand or "fix" them. There is a quiet integrity in simply being present with one's own sorrow.

The **Year of Connection** manifested in two vital ways. The conversation with my uncle provided a somber but necessary bridge to family and the reality of my grandmother's transition. Later, the genuine appreciation from my girlfriend acted as a much-needed lift, reminding me of the impact I have on those closest to me just by being who I am.

Even in this state, my core values surfaced. Standing up for a coworker was a small but significant act of **Unyielding Integrity**. Looking toward tomorrow, the plan to integrate a run with my girlfriend into an early office visit is a tactical way to navigate resistance with health and connection, ensuring that even on difficult days, the "Mind-Body" and "Relationships" goals remain at the center.
