# Life Plan

## Life Chapters

<!-- Map out the major chapters of your life — past, present, and future.
     This isn't a prediction. It's a framework for thinking about where you are
     and where you're heading. Update it as your understanding evolves. -->

**Chapter 1: The Wild Frontier** (20s - 32)
Exploration, learning through experience, and living without a care for tomorrow. A time of high energy, partying, and identifying the foundations of self.

**Chapter 2: The Sustainable Future** (33 - 42)
Current phase. Optimizing health, wealth, and depth. Moving from "getting drunk" to meaningful time with loved ones. Building personal projects and a solid financial base for the future.

**Chapter 3: The Creative Legacy** (43+)
Transitioning to full creative ownership. Running a video game studio, mentoring a team that feels like family, and living a life balanced between high-impact creation and soul-recharging adventures.

## 10-Year Vision

I am the owner of a thriving video game studio. My morning starts at 5 AM with a cold plunge, breathwork, and a quiet hour of reading and coffee. When my family wakes up, the house is full of warmth. I take the kids to school, then drive to an office where my colleagues feel like family. We work on ambitious projects that have marinated for years—creating with passion, not fear.

In the afternoon, I recharge my soul with a hike. Returning home, my wife and I share a moment of deep, passionate connection—reminding ourselves that we are lovers first, parents second. We pick up the kids, and I return to my projects with a sense of flow and purpose. Success is not just the output, but the balance of the day.

## Not Prioritizing

- **Superficial Socializing**: Saying no to "getting drunk" for the sake of it or spending time with people who don't add depth.
- **Short-term Hedonism**: Sacrificing future health or financial stability for immediate, fleeting comfort.

---

## Relationships

- **Girlfriend**: Deepening our bond and navigating the path forward together. A key focus is unpacking our future goals and alignment on family.
- **Friend Circle**: The "chosen family" who receive my deep investment and time. Sustaining sober depth and shared growth.
- **Community**: Being a present and contributing member of my local and professional circles.

## Fears to Watch

1. **The Trap of Comfort**: The risk of slowing down too much and losing the "all-in" edge.
2. **Financial Drift**: Ensuring the transition to creative ownership doesn't compromise the family's safety net.
3. **Erosion of Integrity**: Staying vigilant against external pressures that might bend my internal compass.
