## Core Principles

1. **Comfort is a Trap** — Comfort will destroy you if you let it; growth requires resistance.
2. **Energy Exchange** — If you put in anything less than your all, it's usually not worth doing.
3. **The "Fuck Yes" Rule** — If it's not a "fuck yes," it's a no. Protect your time and energy.
4. **Equilibrium of Logic & Emotion** — Leverage the superpower of seeing the world through both. Be patient and compassionate, giving others the time they need to reach the conclusions you've found.
5. **Unbounded Mind** — The power of your mind is unbounded; anything is within your grasp if you can conceptualize it in your mind first. Clear conceptualization is the first step to realization.
